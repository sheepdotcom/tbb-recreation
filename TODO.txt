Welcome to the Big TODO!

- Something to be done
o Something in-progress
x Something done

x Make basic battler
x Make battlers move (they go left, or right if enemy!, fear will be added later)
o Make battlers attack (they stop when in range of an enemy which is yay!)
	x Make battlers stop when in range of another enemy (probably done but keep checking)
	o Make battlers follow cancellable pre-windup of like 0.5 seconds
		- Check to make sure it actually cancels
	x Make battlers do windup of whatever their stat is (also make it cancellable through script but not automatically when enemy leaves range; im preparing for ivory but also stun/super stun)
	x Make battlers actually do attacks
		x Make battlers be able to damage each other
o Make battlers have health
	x Make battlers have visible health bar
	x Make battlers be able to take damage
	o Make battlers able to die
	- Make armor work
	- Make resistance work
	- Make armor and resistance piercing (preparing for sniper, fencer/scherma, miner/prospect)
	- (future thing) Make battlers have phases (and could potentially survive lethal hits like lil' cesus, tumored/tarnished sword)
- Make battlers follow gravity (probably custom idk; maybe not idk)
- Make bases
- Make battlers spawnable
	- Figure out how to make UI
		- Figure out how to make a button
o Moveable Camera
	- Moving in a direction tilts the camera a bit that way (i think? idk)
	- Camera looks towards the camera
	- Camer shake i guess?
